Rug is a basic gaming library for Ruby, based on Love2D for Lua. The goal is to promote
rapid game development by handling the boiler plate details under the hood and leave the
fun stuff for the programmer.

============================
        Installation
============================

Rug has been tested under Ubuntu Linux and Windows, both of these platforms work. You
can get the binary versions from the Downloads section on github.

You can also install the gem:

    gem install Rug

============================
   Building from source
============================

To build:

    cd ext
    ruby extconf.rb
    make

At the moment there are no pre-built versions of Rug for you to download. These will
be made available as soon as possible.

============================
        Dependencies
