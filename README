Rug is a basic gaming library for Ruby, based on Love2D for Lua. The goal is to promote
rapid game development by handling the boiler plate details under the hood and leave the
fun stuff for the programmer.

        Installation
============================

At the moment only Linux has been tested, but the library should work on any system
that supports both Ruby and SDL. You need the SDL libraries installed in order to 
build Rug.

To build:

    ruby extconf.rb
    make
