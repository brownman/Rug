Rug is a basic gaming library for Ruby, based on Love2D for Lua. The goal is to promote
rapid game development by handling the boiler plate details under the hood and leave the
fun stuff for the programmer.

============================
        Dependencies
============================

In order to build Rug, you need a few dependencies:
  - Ruby development headers
  - SDL
  - SDL_image

In Ubuntu, you can install these with apt-get:

  sudo apt-get install ruby-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev

============================
        Installation
============================

At the moment only Linux has been tested, but the library should work on any system
that supports both Ruby and SDL. You need the SDL libraries installed in order to 
build Rug.

To build:

    ruby extconf.rb
    make

At the moment there are no pre-built versions of Rug for you to download. These will
be made available as soon as possible.
